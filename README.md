# 📊 Principal Component Analysis (PCA) with R

## 📝 Description
This project demonstrates the application of **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** using the **R programming language**, focusing on both the **theoretical understanding** and **visual interpretation** of the results.  
The analysis explores how PCA can reduce data dimensionality while preserving the most significant variance, allowing for a clearer visualization and interpretation of complex datasets.

---

## 🎯 Objective
To perform **dimensionality reduction** through Principal Component Analysis and visually interpret the main components, highlighting their importance in explaining data variability.

---

## ⚙️ Project Overview
The project is divided into two parts:  
1. **principal components analysis.R** — performs the PCA, calculates eigenvalues, variances, and principal components.  
2. **principal component charts.R** — visualizes the results using biplots, scree plots, and component correlation graphs.  

Through these scripts, the project provides a step-by-step implementation of PCA and helps interpret how each principal component contributes to the dataset’s overall structure.

## 🧰 Technologies Used
- **R** — main programming language  
- **stats** — built-in R package for PCA computation (`prcomp`)  
- **ggplot2** — visualization of principal components and variance distribution  
- **factoextra** — graphical representation of PCA results and clustering visualization  
- **dplyr** — data manipulation and transformation prior to analysis  

---

## 📈 Results
The analysis successfully reduces dataset dimensionality, identifying the most influential components responsible for explaining data variance.  
The visual outputs, such as **scree plots** and **biplots**, effectively illustrate the contribution of each variable to the principal components, supporting clearer data-driven insights.

## 🚀 Future Improvements
- Add comparison between PCA and other dimensionality reduction methods (e.g., t-SNE, UMAP)  
- Automate chart generation for multiple datasets  
- Integrate interactive visualizations using **Shiny**
